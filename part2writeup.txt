Describe any design decisions you made, including your choice of page eviction policy. If you used something other than a nested-loops join, describe the tradeoffs of the algorithm you chose.

Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.
-Not very many changes were made besides making new data structures like arrays.
Most of the API included calling on previously defined functions that we wrote
for part 1 of the lab. Most of the fnuctions did not tell us what they did or
how to implement them so it was very open. 

Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.
-

Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found 
particularly difficult or confusing.
-The lab was very confusing for the second part because most of the functions
do not explain how to use them or how to implement them. It was also very hard
since we got a lot of system test errors and debugging these issues are hard
because the errors deal with parts of the code that we did not implement. We spent
a large portion of our time on the lab because it was bigger than part 1 and harder
especially since we did not have a lot of time to look it over because we had a
quiz and a midterm in the same week. The first part of the project was definitely
more difficult than the second half due to the fact that the first part of the code is
more important to the whole overall construction of the database.
